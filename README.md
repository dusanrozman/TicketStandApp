# TicketStandApp
The purpose of this project was to create a GUI application that would allow a user to simulate the buying and selling of tickets from a arena vendor. Once the application is compiled and run, the user will be greeted by a window that displays a colorful layout of a stadium. Each button in the grid represents a seat of varying price represented by the color of the button. Yellow are the cheapest seats followed by blue, green and red. While hovering over a button, the price and seat information will be filled out in the right panel. By selecting (clicking) a seat button and turning it grey (reserving the seat) a user can select multiple seats to purchase at a time. Once the seats are selected the user can click the purchase button and continue with his purchase. Upon purchase the seats taken change and get colored in white to indicate they are taken. An administrator can also use the "administrator" button which prompts them to sign in (username: admin, password: "secret"). This will allow them to see a summary window of the tickets sold.
