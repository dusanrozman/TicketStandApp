# TicketStandApp
The purpose of this project was to create a GUI application that would allow a user to simulate the buying and selling tickets at a stadium. Once the application is compiled and run, the user will be greeted by a window that displays a colorful layout of a stadium. Each button in the grid represents a seat of varying price represented by the color of the button. Yellow are the cheapest seats followed by blue, green and red. By selecting clicking a seat button, and turning it grey (reserving the seat) a user can select multiple seats at time to purchase at a time. Once the seats are selected the user clicks the purchase button and preceeds with his purchase. Upon purchase the seats taken change and get colored in white to indicate they are taken. An administrator can also use the "administrator" button where they are prompted to sign in (username: admin, password: "secret") and they cansee a summary window of the tickets sold.
